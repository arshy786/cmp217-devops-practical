# CMP217 DevOps Practical

This repository contains the practical implementation for the CMP217 DevOps module, undertaken as part of my Level 5 undergraduate studies in Software Engineering. The project demonstrates the use of industry-standard DevOps practices, including version control with GitHub, environment configuration management, and continuous integration.

## Project Description
The project builds upon a secure website originally developed for the CMP214 Secure Website Development module. The existing application is being adapted and extended for deployment within a DevOps context, incorporating automation, testing, and deployment workflows.

## Key Features
- Proper use of a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary and sensitive files.
- Secure handling of environment-specific configuration files.
- Foundation for implementing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- Documentation written to professional standards.

## Learning Outcomes
- Apply version control best practices in a real project.
- Understand the role of automation in the software delivery process.
- Manage project structure to improve maintainability and security.
- Produce documentation to a standard suitable for professional development teams.

## Module Context
This practical work contributes to the assessment for CMP217 DevOps, which evaluates understanding and application of:
- Implementing functional DevOps workflows with version control.
- Demonstrating well-structured, maintainable, and secure practices.
- Delivering professional-quality code, documentation, and automation workflows.
